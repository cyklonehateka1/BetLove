On online betting application built with React front-end and FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL as database 

It uses Typescript, as the front-end language and Python as the language for the backend.

I used alembic for the database migration.

If you want to clone the project, check the requirements.txt file to install all the backend packages and the package.json file for the front-end packages. 
Check the env file of both the client and server directories for the environment variables used in the project
